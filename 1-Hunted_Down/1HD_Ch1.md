Chapter I
==============================

I was wondering if I should run over the body, or not. Even if I wanted, I just couldn't go around it. The roadway planted with trees, was way too narrow and it was lying right in the middle of the road. But it is not because you don’t have a choice, that it makes things easier. You can always try to convince yourself that a car cannot kill more a dead person that it is already dead, and that it is easier to roll over it than move it around, I still had one hell of a time to push my foot down that accelerator of mine. Fucking manners. I got out of my car, moaning and looked around me. Fear and pain had permeate all the trees around me and I could hear the power of the earth whispering the suffering. The victim was human. I took a closer look at the body and drew aside the hair that clung to its face. It was a woman, pretty one. She wasn’t hurt, skinned or mutilated – so that’s something at least. I spread out my hand over her body and let my power explore the decaying flesh. No more than a few seconds was what I needed to find what I was looking for, triggering a warning signal in my brain. I had to get out of here fast and get the body out of my way even faster. I grabbed the girl’s legs tight and started pulling her aside. (Because no, moving around a dead body is not as easy as it looks like).

I was almost done when I felt an icy squall along my spine. My heart started beating faster. I closed my eyes and tried feeling my environment – forest had just become strangely quiet and night was starting to close around me. A halo of protective light was about me and I let my power crawl around, looking for the predator.

I didn’t have any trouble decrypting its energy: it was as noticeable as the smell of death.

\-	Get out of here, I said firmly.

However hard I tried, I just couldn’t locate him.

Yet, I felt it near me, wondering if it could come closer.

\-	Very well then, but you asked for it, I whispered.

I took a deep breath and let the magic flow inside of me. A heatwave passed through my body immediately and the energy sprung out of my hands soaring to the trees like a fire tornado.

\-	This was my final warning, I yelled in a threatening tone.

I suddenly heard a burst of laughter a few steps behind me.

\-	Dully noted.

The voice was sensual, hot almost mesmerizing. I turned around.

\-	I thought vampires were quieter, I said, frustrated.

\-	And I, thought witches were more cautious, he answered back, looking amused.


He was wearing black jeans and a tan-colored woolly. His long blond straight hair fell down his back and overlapped his fine aristocratic features of his gorgeous face. He was of an outstanding beauty, inhuman, as can sometimes be those of his kind.

\-	Sorry to tell you this, but night hasn’t completely fallen yet, I told him, eyebrows raised.

He started to smile, showing his fangs.

\-	I am an early riser.

_Great, he’s a joker in addition to all. There are some days, you fell so lucky that you just wanna throw yourself out a window just to see if this all stops in the end._

\-	Trouble sleeping? I mocked.

\-	Sometimes. I had no clue witches liked to grope human corpse, that is an interesting need, he said quickly looking at the girl.

\- That damn body is not mine, she's been dead for over twelve hours... I defended myself.

It made him unhappy.

\- I know. That damn body, as you refer it, is ours.

\- Hasn't anyone ever told you that Human hunting is prohibited? I said, in a reproving tone.

\- You would happen to know that the one who did this - he showed the body - was severely punished and that it wasn't me. I was merely coming here to...

\-  ... do some housecleaning?

\- Precisely.

He started walking toward me. I backed up a little and fell clumsily on my bottom.

\- You looked scared, he whispered.

No wonder I was. Crossing the path of a vampire was not exactly my idea of a good time, meeting one powerful enough to walk in broad day light, that was more like poking hot butter in a wildcat's ear...

\- That was just a reflex reaction, think of it as self-preservation, I said getting back up and rubbing my hands on my jeans.

He was staring me. His blue eyes were so light that they were almost white.

\- At least, you're not entirely unsympathetic. Being scared, is better than nothing.

I just wanted one thing, get the hell out of there.

\- Killing a vampire doesn't really matter to me, but you're not an ordinary one, are you? I said trying to pull myself together.

\- I am not, indeed. But I can reassure you, I wasn't even an ordinary human.

That was probably strange, but I believed him. Usually, I had no trouble knowing where most vampire came from.

Whereas I used their way of speaking and their manners, often unique to a single period or place, but the one standing in from of me, I just couldn't guess his age nor his origin.

He suddenly looked at me as if he knew what I was thinking about and told me in a condescending tone:

\- I am a scythe, though I don't think you know what it means.

Scythe? As in the nomad-that-lived-in-the-steppes-of-Ukraine-and-Siberia-several-centuries-before-Christ scythes? They were considered to be the "first human vampire" as they used to drink the blood of the first man they killed on the battle field and pour it into skulls sawed off, using them as cups. Yummy...

\- You bare your twenty-five hundreds years pretty well, I said with a little smirk.

I felt some admiration in his look.

\- Interested in History, are you?

\- Could be, I answered vaguely.

Two thousand and five hundred years... I was in deep shit, and my intuition was telling me that it was ready to hit the fan. I had been to war and was indeed a battle-hardened veteran, but never in my life have I dealt with an enemy like this one.

\- I am feeling your anxiety, but rest assure. I cannot kill you. As you know, the Peace Treaty has some very strict rules and no one can break them, he said with an apparent regret.

The war between witches, their allies (werewolves, shamans and shape-shifters) and the vampires had officially been stopped, but many were still unhappy with it. And if the supernatural population hadn't been divided by two in the last two hundreds centuries, we will still be ripping each other throats.

\- Well, after this warm fuzzy talk, I'll be leaving now and let you get on with your daily life, I said pointing at the dead body.

His next movement was so fast that I didn't get any time to react. His body was now close to mine. His upper body touching my back. IT was getting pretty uncomfortable here.

\- And do you actually think I am going to let you get away so easily? He whispered in my ear as he reached up to stroke my cheek.

My knees were trembling and my stomach started to ache.

\- Didn't you just tell me that you couldn't kill me?

\- I sure did, he answered letting his hand slide down my back.

I tried ignoring the chills running up and down my spine.

\- So, what do you want then? I snarled.

His lips so well shaped and so sensual were almost on mine.

\- Who are you? He asked in a whisper.

\- Nothing that is your business, I answered gasping for breath as if I just had a 100-meter sprint.

That vampire scum was trying to use his power on me.

\- I should have been informed that a witch had lay a foot on this territory, he said in a vibrating voice tightening his body against mine.

\- Seriously? Well, you better know that I have seen at least a dozen of them since I came here!

I got a condescending smile in return.

\- Don't you think I would know the difference between someone like you and a common Brewer?

Almost all witches were Brewers. They needed to concoct philters and mixtures in order to trigger their magic. I didn't.

I felt his fingers caress my skin.

\- Stop this, you bore me...

He pulled my hair and look into my eyes very deeply.

His eyes filled with burning flames and a severe pain started to penetrate my head. I tried not to scream as I got slammed big-time by his mental attack. Air begin to vibrate around us. I could feel his power searching my brain for any kind of souvenir. And that, I couldn't allow it. I focused and raised my mental barriers as strongly as I could. It took at least a few seconds to catapult him out of my head.

The vampire was surprised but didn't release me.

\- Curiosity can kill the cat, I told him letting my own magic burn and spread through my body.

\- Aren't you full of surprises now... he acknowledge, with a little smirk on his lips.

\- You have no idea, I said touching his torso with my hand.

My black hair became scarlet red extending like a fire rainbow, over my head.

The vampire stepped back, as if I had just burned him.

\- Get out of my way, I ordered with an icy smile.

He stiffed and a strange look happened in his face.

\- A war witch... What are you doing here, so far from your kind?

He couldn't look more curious.

\- I'll repeat it once, it is none of your business, I answered.

\- That is where you are very wrong, young lady...

I didn't see how all this could end, as we weren't supposed to fight, so...

\- Listen, I don't have plan on answering any of your questions and you don't plan on killing me, so what should we do? Still fight and break the rules? Do you want to satisfy your curiosity or do you let me go? I asked furious.

His face was expressionless, but his eyes seems to try to break my soul like a creepy dagger.

\- I won't tear up the treaty, he finally answered in a neutral voice.

_Great, finally some good news._

\- Well, then I guess that's all folks, I said walking toward my car.

\- I wouldn't be so sure, he told me back, as I went inside my old Chrysler and hit the ground running.

A few minutes (and some exceeding speed limit) later, I finally saw the reassuring city lights. Well... City, might be an overstatement.

Burlington, Vermont, New England, was considered to be by the rest of the country the middle of nowhere. Lovely, but terribly boring. That suited me, at first, until I found out that this backwater town was in reality one of the oldest supernatural community of the country. Of course, you will tell me that nothing is truly perfect... and you might be right, if I knew, I might have had thought a little more about moving in, six months ago.  The visitor center should have mentioned it in their flyers. Something like : "Come to Burlington, enjoy fishing and water sports at the Champlain Lake in the summer as well as the really long and really cold north-eastern winter, where you can ski and hike in snowshoe. And don't forget to bring some guns fully loaded with silver bullets, one or two sticks, three or four flamethrowers, as some local residents might be a little testy..."

Of course, for that kind of marketing to happen, ordinary humans would have to be aware that we existed, and that surely wasn't going to happen. But let's face it. No one truly believed that the secret would stay hidden for very long, especially with the development of the Internet, science and the Medias. And I've got to say, I was worried about this. I was even more worried about the fact that we were so much in such a sparsely populated town. That such concentration of power was not that common. I did try to do some research to understand what had driven werewolves, shape-shifters witches and vampires to lose themselves here, but didn't get much from them.
Nothing actually, except the fact that vampires were brought back from France to Canada in 1609 by Samuel de Champlain and the French settlers.

And as my grandmother always said: " When there is trouble somewhere, you can be sure that French are behind it somewhere."

And she knew what she was talking about. She was French and an element warrior. Exactly like me.
