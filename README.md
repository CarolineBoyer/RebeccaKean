LICENSE - a few words
======================

The Rebecca Kean Series are a property of Cassandra O'Donnell published by J'ai Lu.

Though they do not exist in English officially, I must ask you to get your own copy (French, and hopefully English one day) in order to support this brillant ( according to me ) author.

I cannot claim to have a perfect translation (being French myself). But I do claim not to have the perfect translation. After all, this translation have been done as an exercice for a american friend and a hobby. 

Therefore, I do not mind the translation to be read, some improvements to be given through pull request on Github ( and encourage people to do so ). But I do mind this translation being used in a profit way or sold as the official one.
